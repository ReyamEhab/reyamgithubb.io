Your task is to build an interactive website using web technologies. Your project should make use of the range of techniques you have explored during the module and demonstrate your understanding of these techniques and ability to deploy them successfully. For this assessment you have to decide a theme on which you will create your website.

For the above themes, you can pick/adapt any existing website as your reference idea, or make one up. There are some creative/technical constraints to consider:

● The piece must deploy HTML5 and CSS.
● The website must include at least 5 pages in which the user
must be able to make navigational decisions (e.g. pick where they want
to go next).
● Your website should include media assets (i.e. still images, moving
images, (audio or video if possible)) to make your website more interactive and engaging.
● Javascript and related languages/technologies may be used to enhance
your website.

The Development Document 

Your Web Development Project must be accompanied by a Development Document of a minimum of 1000 words (there is no maximum word count). 

Please include the following elements (note the suggested word counts):

Brief: A very short description of what you have been asked to develop (50 words).


Design Direction: What theme did you choose and why? What is the underlying concept of the piece? (300 words).


Technical Description & Walkthrough:  In this section you should provide a link to a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This technical breakdown should explain how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The video technical description & walkthrough contributes to the overall word count. The anticipated length of the video is 3-5 minutes.


Critical Reflection: An evaluation of your project that notes what is compelling about the work, what could be improved, and what web programming techniques you need to learn to make such improvements (300 words).
